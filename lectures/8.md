# Optimization with inequality constraints

## Example of inequality constraints

$$
f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 \;\;\;\; g(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1
$$

$$
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & g(x) \leq 0
\end{split}
$$

## Optimization with inequality constraints

Thus, if the constraints of the type of inequalities are inactive in the constrained problem, then don't worry and write out the solution to the unconstrained problem. However, this is not the whole story. Consider the second childish example

$$
f(x) = (x_1 - 1)^2 + (x_2 + 1)^2 \;\;\;\; g(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1
$$

$$
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & g(x) \leq 0
\end{split}
$$

## Optimization with inequality constraints

So, we have a problem:

$$
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & g(x) \leq 0
\end{split}
$$

Two possible cases:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
$g(x) \leq 0$ is inactive. $g(x^*) < 0$

* $g(x^*) < 0$
* $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$
* $\nabla^2 f(x^*) > 0$

:::

. . .

::: {.column width="60%"}
$g(x) \leq 0$ is active. $g(x^*) = 0$

* $g(x^*) = 0$
* Necessary conditions: $- \nabla f(x^*) = \lambda \nabla g(x^*)$, $\lambda > 0$
* Sufficient conditions: $\langle y, \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*) y \rangle > 0, \forall y \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n : \nabla g(x^*)^\top y = 0$

## Lagrange function for inequality constraints

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

Combining two possible cases, we can write down the general conditions for the problem:

$$
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & g(x) \leq 0
\end{split}
$$

Let's define the Lagrange function:

$$
L(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \lambda g(x)
$$

The classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker first and second-order optimality conditions for a local minimizer $x^*$, stated under some regularity conditions, can be written as follows.

:::

. . .

::: {.column width="65%"}

If $x^*$ is a local minimum of the problem described above, then there exists a unique Lagrange multiplier $\lambda^*$ such that:

$$
\begin{split}
\uncover<+->{& (1) \; \nabla_x L (x^*, \lambda^*) = 0 }\\
\uncover<+->{& (2) \; \lambda^* \geq 0 }\\
\uncover<+->{& (3) \; \lambda^* g(x^*) = 0 }\\
\uncover<+->{& (4) \; g(x^*) \leq 0}\\
\uncover<+->{& (5) \; \forall y \in C(x^*):  \langle y , \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*) y \rangle > 0 }\\
\uncover<+->{&  \text{where } C(x^*) = \{y \ \in \mathbb{R}^n |  \nabla f(x^*)^\top y \leq 0 \text{ and } \forall i \in I(x^*):  \nabla g_i(x^*)^T y \leq 0 \} \text{ is the critical cone.} }\\
\uncover<+->{& I(x^*) = \{i \mid g_i(x^*) = 0\}}
\end{split}
$$

# KKT

## General formulation

$$
\begin{split}
& f_0(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}\\
\text{s.t. } & f_i(x) \leq 0, \; i = 1,\ldots,m\\
& h_i(x) = 0, \; i = 1,\ldots, p
\end{split}
$$

This formulation is a general problem of mathematical programming. 

The solution involves constructing a Lagrange function: 

$$
L(x, \lambda, \nu) = f_0(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^p\nu_i h_i(x)
$$

## Necessary conditions
Let $x^*$, $(\lambda^*, \nu^*)$ be a solution to a mathematical programming problem with zero duality gap (the optimal value for the primal problem $p^*$ is equal to the optimal value for the dual problem $d^*$). Let also the functions $f_0, f_i, h_i$ be differentiable.

* $\nabla_x L(x^*, \lambda^*, \nu^*) = 0$
* $\nabla_\nu L(x^*, \lambda^*, \nu^*) = 0$
* $\lambda^*_i \geq 0, i = 1,\ldots,m$
* $\lambda^*_i f_i(x^*) = 0, i = 1,\ldots,m$
* $f_i(x^*) \leq 0, i = 1,\ldots,m$

## Some regularity conditions
These conditions are needed to make KKT solutions the necessary conditions. Some of them even turn necessary conditions into sufficient (for example, Slater's). Moreover, if you have regularity, you can write down necessary second order conditions $\langle y, \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*, \nu^*) y \rangle \geq 0$ with *semi-definite* hessian of Lagrangian.

* **Slater's condition.** If for a convex problem (i.e., assuming minimization, $f_0,f_{i}$ are convex and $h_{i}$ are affine), there exists a point $x$ such that $h(x)=0$ and $f_{i}(x)<0$ (existence of a strictly feasible point), then we have a zero duality gap and KKT conditions become necessary and sufficient.
* **Linearity constraint qualification.** If $f_{i}$ and $h_{i}$ are affine functions, then no other condition is needed.
* **Linear independence constraint qualification.** The gradients of the active inequality constraints and the gradients of the equality constraints are linearly independent at $x^*$.  
* For other examples, see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions#Regularity_conditions_(or_constraint_qualifications)).

## Proof in simple case

:::{.callout-theorem}

## Subdifferential form of KKT

Let $X$ be a linear normed space, and let $f_j: X \to \mathbb{R}$, $j = 0, 1, \ldots, m$, be convex proper (it never takes on the value $-\infty$ and also is not identically equal to $\infty$) functions. Consider the problem
$$
\begin{split}
& f_0(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in X}\\
\text{s.t. } & f_j(x) \leq 0, \; j = 1,\ldots,m\\
\end{split}
$$
Let $x^* \in X$ be a minimum in problem above and the functions $f_j$, $j = 0, 1, \ldots, m$, be continuous at the point $x^*$. Then there exist numbers $\lambda_j \geq 0$, $j = 0, 1, \ldots, m$, such that
$$
\sum_{j=0}^{m} \lambda_j = 1,
$$
$$
\lambda_j f_j(x^*) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, m,
$$
$$
0 \in \sum_{j=0}^{m} \lambda_j \partial f_j(x^*).
$$

:::

## Proof in simple case

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Proof**

1. Consider the function

    $$
    f(x) = \max\{f_0(x) - f_0(x^*), f_1(x), \ldots, f_m(x)\}.
    $$

    The point $x^*$ is a global minimum of this function. Indeed, if at some point $x_e \in X$ the inequality $f(x_e) < 0$ were satisfied, it would imply that $f_0(x_e) < f_0(x^*)$ and $f_j(x_e) < 0$, $j = 1, \ldots, m$, contradicting the minimality of $x^*$ in problem above. 

2. Then, from Fermat's theorem in subdifferential form, it follows that 

    $$
    0 \in \partial f(x^*).
    $$

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

3. By the Dubovitskii-Milyutin theorem, we have

    $$
    \partial f(x^*) = \text{conv } \left( \bigcup\limits_{j \in I}\partial f_j(x^*)\right),
    $$

    where $I = \{0\} \cup \{j : f_j(x^*) = 0, 1 \leq j \leq m\}$. 

4. Therefore, there exist $g_j \in \partial f_j(x^*)$, $j \in I$, such that

    $$
    \sum_{j \in I} \lambda_j g_j = 0, \quad \sum\limits_{j \in I}\lambda_j = 1, \quad \lambda_j \geq 0, \quad j \in I.
    $$

    It remains to set $\lambda_j = 0$ for $j \notin I$.

## Example. Projection onto a hyperplane

$$
\min \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2, \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x} = b.
$$

. . .

**Solution**

Lagrangian:

. . .

$$
L(\mathbf{x}, \nu) = \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2 + \nu(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x} - b)
$$

. . .

Derivative of $L$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} + \nu\mathbf{a} = 0, \qquad \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} - \nu\mathbf{a}
$$

. . .

$$
\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{y} - \nu\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{a} \qquad \nu = \dfrac{\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{y} - b}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2}
$$

. . .

$$
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} - \dfrac{\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{y} - b}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2}\mathbf{a}
$$


## Example. Projection onto simplex

$$
\min \frac{1}{2} \lVert x - y \rVert^2, \quad \text{s.t.} \quad x^\top 1 = 1, \quad x \geq 0. \quad x
$$

. . .

#### KKT Conditions

The Lagrangian is given by:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \lVert x - y \rVert^2 - \sum_i \lambda_i x_i + \nu (x^\top 1 - 1)
$$

. . .

Taking the derivative of $L$ with respect to $x_i$ and writing KKT yields:

* $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} = x_i - y_i - \lambda_i + \nu = 0$
* $\lambda_i x_i = 0$
* $\lambda_i \geq 0$
* $x^\top 1 = 1, \quad x \geq 0$

# Duality

## Motivation

Duality lets us associate to any constrained optimization problem a concave maximization problem, whose solutions lower bound the optimal value of the original problem. What is interesting is that there are cases, when one can solve the primal problem by first solving the dual one. Now, consider a general constrained optimization problem:

. . .

$$
\text{ Primal: }f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in S}  \qquad \text{ Dual: } g(y) \to \max\limits_{y \in \Omega} 
$$


. . .


We'll build $g(y)$, that preserves the uniform bound:

$$
g(y) \leq f(x) \qquad \forall x \in S, \forall y \in \Omega
$$


. . .


As a consequence:

$$
\max\limits_{y \in \Omega} g(y) \leq \min\limits_{x \in S} f(x)  
$$

## Lagrange duality

We'll consider one of many possible ways to construct $g(y)$ in case, when we have a general mathematical programming problem with functional constraints:


. . .


$$
\begin{split}
& f_0(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}\\
\text{s.t. } & f_i(x) \leq 0, \; i = 1,\ldots,m\\
& h_i(x) = 0, \; i = 1,\ldots, p
\end{split}
$$

. . .

And the Lagrangian, associated with this problem:

$$
L(x, \lambda, \nu) = f_0(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^p\nu_i h_i(x) = f_0(x) + \lambda^\top f(x) + \nu^\top h(x)
$$

## Dual function

We assume $\mathcal{D} = \bigcap\limits_{i=0}^m\textbf{dom } f_i \cap \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^p\textbf{dom } h_i$ is nonempty. We define the Lagrange dual function (or just dual function) $g: \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}$ as the minimum value of the Lagrangian over $x$: for $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^m, \nu \in \mathbb{R}^p$

. . .

$$
g(\lambda, \nu) = \inf_{x \in \mathcal{D}} L(x, \lambda, \nu) = \inf_{x \in \mathcal{D}} \left( f_0(x) +\sum\limits_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^p\nu_i h_i(x) \right)
$$

. . .


When the Lagrangian is unbounded below in $x$, the dual function takes on the value $-\infty$. Since the dual function is the pointwise infimum of a family of affine functions of $(\lambda, \nu)$, it is concave, even when the original problem is not convex.

## Dual function as a lower bound

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Let us show, that the dual function yields lower bounds on the optimal value $p^*$ of the original problem for any $\lambda \succeq 0, \nu$. Suppose some $\hat{x}$ is a feasible point for the original problem, i.e., $f_i(\hat{x}) \leq 0$ and $h_i(\hat{x}) = 0, \; \lambda \succeq 0$. Then we have:

. . .


$$
L(\hat{x}, \lambda, \nu) = f_0(\hat{x}) + \underbrace{\lambda^\top f(\hat{x})}_{\leq 0} + \underbrace{\nu^\top h(\hat{x})}_{= 0} \leq f_0(\hat{x})
$$

. . .


Hence

$$
g(\lambda, \nu) = \inf_{x \in \mathcal{D}} L(x, \lambda, \nu) \leq L(\hat{x}, \lambda, \nu)  \leq f_0(\hat{x})
$$

. . .


$$
g(\lambda, \nu) \leq p^*
$$

:::

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}

A natural question is: what is the *best* lower bound that can be obtained from the Lagrange dual function? 
This leads to the following optimization problem:

. . .

$$
\begin{split}
& g(\lambda, \nu) \to \max\limits_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^m, \; \nu \in \mathbb{R}^p }\\
\text{s.t. } & \lambda \succeq 0
\end{split}
$$

. . .

The term "dual feasible", to describe a pair $(\lambda, \nu)$ with $\lambda \succeq 0$ and $g(\lambda, \nu) > -\infty$, now makes sense. It means, as the name implies, that $(\lambda, \nu)$ is feasible for the dual problem. We refer to $(\lambda^*, \nu^*)$ as dual optimal or optimal Lagrange multipliers if they are optimal for the above problem.

## Example. Linear Least Squares

We are addressing a problem within a non-empty budget set, defined as follows:

. . .

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{min} \quad x^T x \\
    & \text{s.t.} \quad Ax = b,
\end{aligned}
$$

with the matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. 

. . .

This problem is devoid of inequality constraints, presenting $m$ linear equality constraints instead. The Lagrangian is expressed as $L(x, \nu) = x^T x + \nu^T (Ax - b)$, spanning the domain $\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m$. The dual function is denoted by $g(\nu) = \inf_x L(x, \nu)$. Given that $L(x, \nu)$ manifests as a convex quadratic function in terms of $x$, the minimizing $x$ can be derived from the optimality condition

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\nabla_x L(x, \nu) = 2x + A^T \nu = 0,
$$

. . .

leading to $x = -(1/2)A^T \nu$. As a result, the dual function is articulated as

. . .

$$
g(\nu) = L(-(1/2)A^T \nu, \nu) = -(1/4)\nu^T A A^T \nu - b^T \nu,
$$

:::

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}

emerging as a concave quadratic function within the domain $\mathbb{R}^p$. According to the lower bound property, for any $\nu \in \mathbb{R}^p$, the following holds true:

. . .

$$
-(1/4)\nu^T A A^T \nu - b^T \nu \leq \inf\{x^T x \,|\, Ax = b\}.
$$

Which is a simple non-trivial lower bound without any problem solving.

## Example. Two-way partitioning problem

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

We are examining a (nonconvex) problem:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{minimize} \quad x^T W x \\
    & \text{subject to} \quad x_i^2 =1, \quad i=1,\ldots,n,
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

![Illustration of two-way partitioning problem](partition.pdf){width=100%}
:::

. . .

::: {.column width="40%"}

This problem can be construed as a two-way partitioning problem over a set of $n$ elements, denoted as $\{1, \ldots , n\}$: A viable $x$ corresponds to the partition
$$
\{1,\ldots,n\} = \{i|x_i =-1\} \cup \{i|x_i =1\}.
$$

. . .

The coefficient $W_{ij}$ in the matrix represents the expense associated with placing elements $i$ and $j$ in the same partition, while $-W_{ij}$ signifies the cost of segregating them. The objective encapsulates the aggregate cost across all pairs of elements, and the challenge posed by problem is to find the partition that minimizes the total cost.

:::

::::

## Example. Two-way partitioning problem

We now derive the dual function for this problem. The Lagrangian is expressed as
$$
L(x,\nu) = x^T W x + \sum_{i=1}^n \nu_i (x_i^2 -1) = x^T (W + \text{diag}(\nu)) x - \mathbf{1}^T \nu.
$$
. . .

By minimizing over $x$, we procure the Lagrange dual function: 
$$
g(\nu) = \inf_x x^T (W + \text{diag}(\nu)) x - \mathbf{1}^T \nu
= \begin{cases}\begin{array}{ll}
    -\mathbf{1}^T\nu & \text{if } W+\text{diag}(\nu) \succeq 0 \\
    -\infty & \text{otherwise},
\end{array} \end{cases}
$$

. . .

exploiting the realization that the infimum of a quadratic form is either zero (when the form is positive semidefinite) or $-\infty$ (when it's not).

. . .

This dual function furnishes lower bounds on the optimal value of the problem. For instance, we can adopt the particular value of the dual variable
$$
\nu = -\lambda_{\text{min}}(W) \mathbf{1}
$$

. . .

which is dual feasible, since $W +\text{diag}(\nu)=W -\lambda_{\text{min}}(W) I \succeq 0.$

. . .

This renders a simple bound on the optimal value $p^*$: $p^* \geq -\mathbf{1}^T\nu = n \lambda_{\text{min}}(W).$

. . .

The code for the problem is available here [\faPython Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MerkulovDaniil/optim/blob/master/assets/Notebooks/Partitioning.ipynb)

# Strong duality

## Strong duality

It is common to name this relation between optimals of primal and dual problems as **weak duality**. For problem, we have: 

$$
p^* \geq d^*
$$

. . .

While the difference between them is often called **duality gap:** 

$$
p^* - d^* \geq 0
$$

. . .

Note, that we always have weak duality, if we've formulated primal and dual problem. It means, that if we have managed to solve the dual problem (which is always concave, no matter whether the initial problem was or not), then we have some lower bound. Surprisingly, there are some notable cases, when these solutions are equal.

. . .

**Strong duality** happens if duality gap is zero: 

$$
p^* = d^*
$$

. . .

Notice: both $p^*$ and $d^*$ may be $\infty$. 

* Several sufficient conditions known!
* âEasyâ necessary and sufficient conditions: unknown.

## Strong duality in linear least squares

:::{.callout-exercise}
In the Least-squares solution of linear equations example above calculate the primal optimum $p^*$ and the dual optimum $d^*$ and check whether this problem has strong duality or not.
:::

## Useful features of duality

* **Construction of lower bound on solution of the primal problem.**

    It could be very complicated to solve the initial problem. But if we have the dual problem, we can take an arbitrary $y \in \Omega$ and substitute it in $g(y)$ - we'll immediately obtain some lower bound.

* **Checking for the problem's solvability and attainability of the solution.** 

    From the inequality $\max\limits_{y \in \Omega} g(y) \leq \min\limits_{x \in S} f_0(x)$ follows: if $\min\limits_{x \in S} f_0(x) = -\infty$, then $\Omega = \varnothing$ and vice versa.

* **Sometimes it is easier to solve a dual problem than a primal one.** 

    In this case, if the strong duality holds: $g(y^*) = f_0(x^*)$ we lose nothing.

* **Obtaining a lower bound on the function's residual.** 

    $f_0(x) - f_0^* \leq f_0(x) - g(y)$ for an arbitrary $y \in \Omega$ (suboptimality certificate). Moreover, $p^* \in [g(y), f_0(x)], d^* \in [g(y), f_0(x)]$

* **Dual function is always concave**

    As a pointwise minimum of affine functions.

## Slater's condition 

:::{.callout-theorem}
If for a convex optimization problem (i.e., assuming minimization, $f_0,f_{i}$ are convex and $h_{i}$ are affine), there exists a point $x$ such that $h(x)=0$ and $f_{i}(x)<0$ (existance of a strictly feasible point), then we have a zero duality gap and KKT conditions become necessary and sufficient.
:::

## An example of convex problem, when Slater's condition does not hold

:::{.callout-example}

$$
\min \{ f_0(x) = x \mid f_1(x) = \frac{x^2}{2} \leq 0 \}, 
$$

. . .

The only point in the budget set is: $x^* = 0$. However, it is impossible to find a non-negative $\lambda^* \geq 0$, such that 
$$
\nabla f_0(0) + \lambda^* \nabla f_1(0) = 1 + \lambda^* x = 0.
$$

:::

## A nonconvex quadratic problem with strong duality

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

On rare occasions strong duality obtains for a nonconvex problem. As an important example, we consider the problem of minimizing a nonconvex quadratic function over the unit ball

. . .

$$

\end{split}
$$

where $A \in \mathbb{S}^n, A \nsucceq 0$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Since $A \nsucceq 0$, this is not a convex problem. This problem is sometimes called the trust region problem, and arises in minimizing a second-order approximation of a function over the unit ball, which is the region in which the approximation is assumed to be approximately valid.

**Solution**

. . .

Lagrangian and dual function

$$
L(x, \lambda) = x^\top A x + 2 b^\top x + \lambda (x^\top x - 1) = x^\top( A + \lambda I)x + 2 b^\top x - \lambda
$$

. . .

$$
g(\lambda) = \begin{cases} -b^\top(A + \lambda I)^{\dagger}b - \lambda &\text{ if } A + \lambda I \succeq 0 \\ -\infty, &\text{ otherwise}  \end{cases}
$$

. . .

Dual problem:

$$
\begin{split}
& -b^\top(A + \lambda I)^{\dagger}b - \lambda \to \max\limits_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}}\\
\text{s.t. } & A + \lambda I \succeq 0
\end{split}
$$

. . .

$$
\begin{split}
& -\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{(q_i^\top b)^2}{\lambda_i + \lambda} - \lambda  \to \max\limits_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}}\\
\text{s.t. } & \lambda \geq - \lambda_{min}(A)
\end{split}
$$
